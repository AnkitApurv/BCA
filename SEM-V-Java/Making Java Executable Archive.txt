A jar file is simply a file containing a collection of java files. To make a jar file executable, you need to specify where the "main" Class is in the jar file. Example code would be as follows.

//main class
public class JarExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {}
}

Compile your classes. To make a jar, you also need to create a Manifest File (MANIFEST.MF). For example;

//manifest.mf
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: JarExample

Place the compiled output class files (JarExample.class,JarExample$1.class) and the manifest file in the same folder. In the command prompt, go to the folder where your files placed, and create the jar using jar command. For example (if you name your manifest file as jexample.mf;

//make jar command
jar cfm jarexample.jar jexample.mf *.class

It will create executable jarexample.jar.
